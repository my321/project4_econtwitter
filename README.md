### Project Title:
Analyzing Language Used on EconTwitter
</p>

<p> 
  
### Description:
EconTwitter developed as an alternative forum for economists to discuss ideas, promote papers, and generally socialize with each other. An alternative forum was needed after a paper by Alice Wu revealed the extent of gendered language used on a popular anonymous forum EJMR. EconTwitter is advertised as a more supportive environment. The purpose of this project is to analyze the language used on EconTwitter to see if this is true or if gendered language still exists. First, I analyzed all the tweets for topics. Then I tried to identify tweets that were likely referring to a woman and tweets that were likely referring to a man. I analyzed if the topic distribution is the same in the two groups. Lastly, I tried to identify topics by the two groups. 

<p> 
  
### Models Used:
Used NMF and LSA topic modeling to identify topics. 
</p>

<p> 
  
### Data Used:
Scraped economist twitter usernames from RePEc. Then used the usernames to scrape tweets from Dec. 2020 to Feb. 2020. 340,000 tweets were pulled, but after removing non-English tweets 205,000 tweets remained.

### Tools Used:

### Possible impacts of your project:
Economics has a historic problem with women. The proportion of women in STEM fields has grown since the 80s, while it has stagnated in Economics. This issue has been highlighted more recently and efforts are being made to address the underrepresenation of women in the field. The kind of language we use is an important indicator of how we view people. Any evidence of gendered language or generally negative language on EconTwitter is a sign that even supportive communinities can fall short of their goal. Saying you are supportive is different than actually being supportive.
